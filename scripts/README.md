## Align and Average Structure
This python script is used to align the reactant and product structures of a PCET reaction and calculate the averaged structure. 
It first overlays the reactant and product structures so the proton donor and acceptor are superimposed and then minimizes the RMSD of the remaining nuclei while maintaining this constraint. 
Then the average structure is generated by averaging all the Cartesian coordinates of the nuclei.
